## Error Handling

During the development of this application, there were a couple of issues encountered:
- Accidental upload of sensitive information in the `creds.json` file. The file was promptly removed from the repository, and the commit history was purged. The `.gitignore` rules were updated to prevent future incidents.
- Deployment challenges on Heroku due to an incorrect `requirements.txt` file. The file was reviewed and updated with the necessary dependencies to ensure successful deployment.

## CI Python Linter

The Python code in this project has been validated using a linter to ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
